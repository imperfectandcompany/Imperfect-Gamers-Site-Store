Software License Agreement

This Software License Agreement ("Agreement") is made and entered into as of
2024-05-05 ("Effective Date") by and between Imperfect and Company LLC, a
registered company, having its principal place of business at 6633 18 Mile Rd,
United States ("Licensor"), and the entity or individual accepting this
Agreement ("Licensee").

The "Licensee" refers to any entity or individual who has legally obtained
the Software, either directly from the Licensor or through an authorized
distributor, and who agrees to the terms of this Agreement, irrespective of
geographic location. Unauthorized acquisition, use, or distribution of the
Software does not confer any rights under this Agreement and is subject to
legal action.

1. Definition of Software:
   The term "Software" refers to the Imperfect Gamers Site, including any
   updates, modifications, or associated documentation provided by the Licensor.

2. Intellectual Property Rights:
   All intellectual property rights in the Software shall remain the property
   of the Licensor. The Licensee does not acquire any rights to the Software
   except for the limited use rights specified in this Agreement.

3. Licensor hereby grants Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited
   license to use the Software solely for evaluation purposes and at the
   discretion of the Licensor. This License does not grant any rights to
   modify, distribute, or create derivative works of any kind.

4. Scope of License:
   The software is licensed, not sold. Imperfect and Company LLC reserves all
   other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this
   limitation, you will not (and have no right to):
   - Work around any technical limitations in the software that only allow you
     to use it in certain ways;
   - Remove, minimize, block, or modify any notices of Imperfect and Company
     LLC or its partners in the software;
   - Use the software for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by this
     Agreement.

5. Ownership and Intellectual Property:
   All rights, title, and interest in and to the Software and its related
   documentation are owned by Imperfect and Company LLC. The Software is
   provided under this License on an "as is" basis and is not subject to
   modification, distribution, or unauthorized use.

6. Definition of Evaluation Purposes:
   Evaluation purposes are strictly limited to authorized parties who have
   been granted explicit permission by Imperfect and Company LLC to evaluate.
   Evaluation consists of accessing the production, live-hosted official
   version of the Software to review and analyze Imperfect and Company or
   Imperfect Gamers (a division under Imperfect and Company) for potential
   investment or partnership. Evaluators are not permitted to test, use, or
   interact with the Software itself apart from what is provided on the
   live-hosted platform. Evaluators are permitted to view the repository's
   code in a read-only format under condition that the official repository is
   purposefully set to public visibility, without the ability or permission
   to download, copy, modify, or interact with the software beyond what is
   provided on the live-hosted platform. No commercial use is permitted under
   this License.

7. Authorized Access:
   Access to the Software and its repository is granted only to individuals or
   entities directly authorized by Imperfect and Company LLC. However, if the
   repository URL is obtained through third-party sharing or incidental
   discovery, individuals or entities may express their interest in partnership
   or evaluation by contacting Imperfect and Company LLC to undergo a formal
   authorization process. Unauthorized access does not confer the right to
   interact with the Software outside of accessing our publicly available
   hosted production live on imperfectgamers.org. All potential partners or
   evaluators must comply with the established procedures, including signing a
   Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and obtaining explicit permission from
   Imperfect and Company LLC before any further engagement with the Software or
   related materials.

8. Restrictions:
   The Licensee agrees not to modify, reproduce, redistribute, reverse
   engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software. The Software shall only be
   accessed via the official repository link provided by Imperfect and Company
   LLC and is not to be hosted or run on any servers not expressly authorized
   by Imperfect and Company LLC. Developers authorized by Imperfect and Company
   LLC may update the Software directly to the official repository. However,
   they are strictly prohibited from creating forks, branches, or redistributing
   the software in any form.

9. Visibility Clause:
   The Software repository is publicly accessible to allow potential investors,
   partners, and other expressly authorized parties to review its capabilities
   for evaluation purposes under a controlled setting. While the repository's
   public status facilitates transparency and engagement opportunities, it does
   not grant any rights for public use, copying, modification, or any
   interaction beyond read-only access. Unauthorized access, use, or
   redistribution of the repository's contents without express written consent
   from Imperfect and Company LLC is strictly prohibited and may lead to legal
   action. This includes incidental discovery of the repository through shared
   links or any other means not explicitly sanctioned by Imperfect and Company
   LLC. This public status is not an invitation for public use, copying, or
   modification. Imperfect and Company LLC retains the right to transition the
   repository to a private status based on strategic business milestones or at
   its discretion.

10. Separability of the License:
    If any provision of this License is found to be invalid, illegal, or
    unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be
    severed from the License. The remaining provisions shall continue to be
    valid and enforceable, ensuring the integrity of the License as a whole.

11. Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure:
    Access to the Software by potential investors or partners is subject to the
    terms of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) that must be signed prior to such
    access. This agreement strictly prohibits the disclosure, copying, or
    unauthorized use of any part of the Software and its related materials.

12. Hosting and Operational Rights:
    Hosting and operation of the Software environment must be conducted
    exclusively by Imperfect and Company LLC and only under the domain
    imperfectgamers.org. This condition applies as long as the domain is owned
    by Imperfect and Company LLC or Daiyaan Ijaz, or while Daiyaan Ijaz is a
    member of Imperfect and Company LLC. If ownership or authorization
    privileges related to the domain or software are changed, these license
    terms may be renegotiated and reestablished by Daiyaan Ijaz at any point in
    time.

13. Application to Repository Packages and CI/CD Pipelines:
    These licensing terms also apply to all repository packages available at
    https://github.com/orgs/imperfectandcompany/packages?repo_name=imperfect-
    gamers-site and proprietary software used in our CI/CD pipelines, such as
    the Imperfect Host Webhook at
    https://github.com/imperfectandcompany/Imperfect-Host-Webhook. This webhook
    is triggered to pull the latest updates from our running containers when
    packages are published or updated as a result of successful merges into the
    development branch.

14. Termination:
    This License is effective until terminated by Licensor at any point with or
    without notice. Upon termination, the Licensee must cease all use of the
    Software and destroy all copies made.

15. Limitation on and Exclusion of Damages:
    If you have any basis for recovering damages, you can recover from Imperfect
    and Company LLC and its suppliers only direct damages up to U.S. $5.00. You
    cannot recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits,
    special, indirect, or incidental damages. This limitation applies to:
    - Anything related to the software, services, or content (including code) on
      third party Internet sites, or third party applications;
    - Claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition,
      strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by
      applicable law.

16. Governing Law:
    This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
    laws of the United States.

17. Reinforcement of Proprietary Rights:
    The Imperfect Gamers site, including its UI/UX and technical
    implementation, design, and strategy, is the proprietary property of
    Imperfect Gamers, which is owned by Imperfect and Company LLC. Public
    viewing of the Software is permitted solely for evaluation and potential
    business engagement with Imperfect and Company LLC. No rights are granted
    for use beyond this scope.

18. Enforcement of License Terms:
    Imperfect and Company LLC reserves the right to seek legal recourse against
    any party who violates the terms of this license. This includes unauthorized
    use, copying, modification, or distribution of the Software, regardless of
    the means by which access was gained. Enforcement actions may include claims
    for damages, injunctive relief to prevent ongoing violations, and other
    legal remedies available under the laws of the United States.

19. Upcoming Revision Notice:
    The Licensor hereby notifies the Licensee that there will be an upcoming
    revision to this Agreement. The revision is expected to be published during
    the week following the Effective Date of this Agreement. Licensee is
    encouraged to review the revised Agreement upon its publication.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Software License Agreement
as of the Effective Date.
